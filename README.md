<h2>📌CV highlights:</h2>

- **Visma Summer Intern**: Worked on an agile 5-person team researching and implementing a docs-as-code approach to Visma documentation. Gained experience with Docusaurus, JavaScript/TypeScript, and React.

Currently in my second year as a TA for Security and Robustness, where I grade exercises and mentor students during the fall semester, and change and improve the course exercises during the spring semesters.
